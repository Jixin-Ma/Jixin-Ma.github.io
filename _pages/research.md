**3D Medical Image Super-Resolution Algorithm based on Deep Learning**

2023.08 - Present &ensp; &ensp; State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems, HIT

Supervisor: Prof. Zhijiang Du

- Proposed a dual-frequency aware network (DFAN) for 3D MRI volume super-resolution.
- Proposed an adaptive frequency processing block to extract features of different frequency domains through Fast Fourier Convolution and high-frequency prior, and proposed a novel cross-attention mechanism for feature interaction and aggregation.
- Conducted experiments on two public MRI datasets and outperformed other SOTA methods.
