I am a third-year Master student at [State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems](https://robot.hit.edu.cn/) at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Zhijiang Du](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/duzhjiang).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) in 2022. From 2019 to 2022, I studied Artificial Intelligence as a minor and obtained a minor degree (awarded by [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/)).

My research interest includes medical robotics, surgical navigation, computer vision, mainly focusing on medical image super-resolution tasks.

**MRI Super-Resolution via Hybrid Information Enhancement Network based on Multi-Attention and Adaptive Convolution**

**Jixin Ma\***, Hongjian Yu*, Zhijiang Du, Xin Hua, Zibo Li, and Hui Zhao.

2024 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine

We propose a Hybrid Information Enhanced Network (HIEN) for MRI super-resolution task. In HIEN, We design a Spatial-Channel Hybrid Attention (SCHA) to enhance specific semantics representation by combining spatial and channel self-attention together. We propose a Dynamic High-Frequency Pass Filter (DHPF) to preserve high-frequency information adaptively in pixel-wise.

Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 2024 (SCI Q1, IF=4.9)

We designe a super-resolution reconstruction model for head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. We propose a graph neural network module based on a sparse attention mechanism that connects distant pixel features and identifies influential neighboring pixels for target pixel inpainting.

**DFAN: Dual-Frequency Aware Network for 3D MRI Super-Resolution** 

**Jixin Ma**, Hongjian Yu, Zhijiang Du, Xin Hua, Zibo Li, Qiaohui Lu, Hui Zhao

The 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025, Submitted)

We propose a Dual-Frequency Aware Network (DFAN) for 3D MRI super-resolution. We design an adaptive frequency processing block which can process the features of different frequency domains through a low-frequency encoding unit and a high-frequency encoding unit. We also propose a cross-frequency interaction block for feature interaction based on cross-attention mechanism.
